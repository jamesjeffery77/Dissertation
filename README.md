# Dissertation
This folder contains things I have used in my dissertation

## vae_change_hp
> This folder contains code which allows me to simulate several VAEs back to back, each with different hyperparameters (i.e number of layers / size of latent layer etc). I produce the same charts as I do with the singular VAE.
